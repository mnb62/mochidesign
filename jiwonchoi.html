        <h1 class="title">Ji Won Choi: Adidas Original Brochure</h1>
        <h3 class="info">Typography</h3>
        <h3 class="info">Client: Emily Moody</h3>
        <p>Ji Won Choi is a fashion designer whose focus is to promote positive change in society through design. She
            worked with Adidas to create a line of Adidas Original athletic wear that featured her signature bold lines
            and shapes. This line of clothing was released worldwide on July 27th, 2019.
            Here I have created a mock brochure for a fictional fashion exhibit that would feature Ji Won Choiâ€™s work
            for Adidas. This tri-fold brochure contains a short introduction, quotes from interviews with Ji Won Choi,
            and displays models wearing some of her most popular items.</p>
