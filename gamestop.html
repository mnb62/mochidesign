        <h3 class="info">Client: Emily Moody</h3>
        <p>In this project, the goal was to take an already existing logo and re-design it. I chose GameStop's logo.
            They're original logo is a heavy sans-serif type in black and red. I wanted to re-design to represent their
            customers and give a less intimidating theme. I had a lot of ideas for this project. My earlier concepts
            included DnD and fantasy role-playing game themes like magic chests, armor, and swords. I also explored
            abstracting the iconic hand-held game controller. I picked three strong and different concepts. I liked them
            all but I chose the crown shaped vector. The crown is a symbol of power, and in this case, winning. I gave
            it some pixel-like debris to give it a more digital-feeling.</p>
